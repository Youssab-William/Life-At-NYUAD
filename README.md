# Life-@-NYUAD


### Project Description:
This site shows a glimpse of students' life at New York University Abu Dhabi. It contains a video group work of 4 students worked on it as a project of creating a storytelling piece of art about NYUAD in communcation lab class. The other piece in the website is a gellery of the most pictures I like in NYUAD. It shows my favourite scenes and places on campus [the sunset, the palm trees, the beautiful view of the highline, and the most productive place, the library]  

### The Process of Implementing The Project:
I. At first, I designed my wireframe to be able to visualize the main components of my website. <br/>
II. Second, I started to implement my design using HTML, CSS to build the structure and the style of my website. <br/>
III. Then, I used JS to create the interactive aspects of the website such as the gallery slider and fixed upward buttom that displays once the user get to a deeper height on the websity. <br/>
IV. Lastly, I hosted my website on github servers with the proper documentation you are reading right now.
